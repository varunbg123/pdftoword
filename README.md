# PDF To Word

I have created an app that will convert PDF'S to Word.

The App is a very basic one and is really to help develop my coding skills.

### Download Instructions

Choose one of the following:

Zip file - https://github.com/varunbg123/pdftoword/raw/master/setupfinal.zip

EXE file - https://github.com/varunbg123/pdftoword/raw/master/setupfinal.exe

And soon I will add a folder to download.

Download whichever one you feel you need. The folder version will not require any admin to run

### Instructions to Use:

Press the Open Files to import in the files you would like to be Converted

Press the Save to Button to confirm where you want the converted files to be saved

Press the Convert Button when you are happy to Convert!

There is also the Delete button which will delete any highlighted, also a Clear button that will clear the whole queue.


### BUGS

Bugs that I have found is that the app will tend to hang during a long conversion. No worries it will still convert just slowly.

Might have some issues when opening the folder when the conversion is done. I don't think this affects the conversion but just can't open the folder if they have a space in the name.



### POTENTIAL ADDITIONS

I would like to add a progress bar to this to have a more visual presentation of the conversion.
